A new directory created to store the project progress.
This directory contains three subdirectories
sys16: This directory contains 16x16 vector multipler verilog implementation. This is the goal of the 
architecture
sys4: This directory contains 4x4 vector multiplier verilog implementation
system: This directory contains the overall system architecture and intended use of the HW multiplier
built in sys16. Navigate to system/ProjectDoc.pdf file to get an overview of the approach. The accelerator would result
in 500% speedup in the intended application
