A new directory created to store the project progress.
This directory contains three subdirectories
sys16: This directory contains 16x16 vector multipler verilog implementation. It  uses a systolic array architecture using 
a 2x2 matrix multiplier as a processing element. There are 64, 2x2 multiplier used to generate a 16x16 multiplication in 
16 clock cycles. using This is the goal of the HW accelerateor architecture and appears to be world class based on available 
research.
sys4: This directory contains 4x4 vector multiplier verilog implementation usinga  2x2 multiplier as a PE. I added this to 
demonstrate a fully functional synthesizable flow that created a GDS output.The origial 16x16 was too complex to run on the 
Openlane SW and ran out of SW 
system: This directory contains the overall system architecture and intended use of the HW multiplier
demonstrated in sys16. Navigate to system/ProjectDoc.pdf file to get an overview of the approach. The accelerator would result
in 500% speedup in the intended application. (Assuming 6x acceleration due to HW accelerator to a the overall CNN object
detection workflow which spends 85% of the time in the vector multiplication)
