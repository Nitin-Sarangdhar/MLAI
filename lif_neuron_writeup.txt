I chose challenge 4 The Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron is a simplified mathematical model of a biological neuron. I have some experience with spiking neuron based neural network where the same was implemented in a silicon.

Verilog source code: lif_neuron.v
Verilog test bench: lif_neuron_tb.v
Verilog simulator output: simulation_results.txt
Compiled Verilog code:  lif_neuron_tb.vvp

In order to get to this point
1. Installed WSL on my windows laptop. Allowed me to use Linux environment
2. Installed iverilog in the Linux environment.
3. created the source files
4. compiled code.
5. Found and observed results
6. Some results were not as expected so updated the source file
7. Saved the results in the output file as expected.

Next steps
Observe the results in a graphical user interface
Observe HW used in my source code.
